## üìù Notes and Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Database Schema**: Using JSONB for flexible data storage (insights, content_chunks)
2. **Vector Search**: Implementing both semantic and hybrid search functions
3. **Authentication**: Using Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
4. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
5. **Backend**: FastAPI + Supabase + OpenAI integration

### Configuration Choices
1. **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive configuration for all services
2. **Development Scripts**: Automated setup and start scripts
3. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks for Python formatting
4. **Testing**: Separate test configurations for backend and frontend
